Thanks a lot for my groupmate [**Patrick Bello**](https://github.com/mayorbcode) who helps me a lot to do code review and fix my big problem with using MongoDB Atlas!!

Some code come from Tony's sample code in class [SAIT WBDV](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/)  https://github.com/sait-wbdv/in-class

and [Michael Mardel](https://github.com/aggressiveperfector) (server.js / JSON endpoint )



## Comments

I met a big problem in using MongoDB Atlas. All the things show well in my terminal but I can not find any result shown in my collection on MongoDB Atlas. Then Patrick reviewed my code and fixed the problem of my "Json endpoint" in server.js and my import.js. We also found that the database name in the copy code for the "Connect to Cluster" is not necessary , as Tony said "it can be anything you named". Even though I still can not know MongoDB Atlas very well, I learn and review more about this part through doing this assignment. 

Thank you for teaching!
